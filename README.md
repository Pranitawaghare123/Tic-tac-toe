This repository contains a classic Tic-Tac-Toe game built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It lets two players take turns placing X and O on a 3×3 grid, checks for wins or draws, and displays the game result at the end. The logic handles player turns, win detection, and UI updates, making it a simple and interactive web game that demonstrates basic DOM manipulation and event handling in JavaScript.
